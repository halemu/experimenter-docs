We've learned a few ways to de-risk experiments and rollouts before they launch.  Below is not an exhausive list for every situation - but a list of the some common situations to help you avoid known pitfalls.  

You are the expert in your area and the final responsibility/decision regarding if your change is sufficiently prepared to go live to hundreds of thousands or millions of people.

# Is this study partner related? #

If a partner is involved in any way, it raises risk. If the answer to this question is "yes" - a [Legal Review](https://experimenter.info/legal-sign-off) and possibly a VP Sign-off are required.  

A partner could also be affected indirectly, for example if functionality or presentation is altered to display less of a partners content or search capabilities - this may violate an agreement with them.

We could engage a partner as a hosting or processing service or present a partner add-on.  In this case Legal needs to be engaged to make sure we aren't misaligned with privacy policies, data handling, any other negotiations around revenue, licensing, contractual obligations, trademark usage, etc. 

Please write legal-product@mozilla.com (if you are not already engaged with Legal) and explain what you want to do with the partner, to how many people (% of population and channel), and the potential outcomes.   You can also file a [legal bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Legal&component=Product%20-%20data)

### What's the difference between "Experimenter" and "Nimbus"?

Nimbus is the code name of the experimentation project, so Nimbus refers to **the whole experimentation system** (handles enrolling/unenrolling users, sending branch configurations, etc). Experimenter is the **customer interface to both Nimbus and Jetstream** that you access at http://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/. In Experimenter, users can configure experiments, manage them (launch, monitor, end), and can see the results.

### What is Jetstream?

[Jetstream](/deep-dives/jetstream/overview) is the whole **analysis system** (interfaces with data, runs analysis, formats results).

### What is Normandy?

Normandy (https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/legacy/) is the legacy experimentation platform for Firefox. It is being deprecated in favor of Nimbus.

### How long does it take to see changes (for time sensitive QA or hotfixes especially)?  CDN

- Nimbus uses remote setting to get changes to users.  Remote settings pushes updates to its CDN once an hour.  Then it has geoip specific dns resolution and caching and etc.  

- Depending when you make your change and when RS propagates to CDNs - it could take minutes to just over an hour.

- Desktop clients only recompute enrollments at startup and every six hours thereafter.

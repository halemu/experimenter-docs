## Experimenter

🛎️ Subscribe to notifications

   > Non-owners can now [subscribe to notifications](/notifications). Previously, these notifications were only being sent to experiment owners. This feature is available for all users and all experiments, and can be found in the Overview section on the Summary page of an experiment. (erichards) [EXP-4229](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-4229)


🙌 [Recipe branches are now available from the include/exclude dropdowns](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-4187).  
   > Not only can include and exclude running and previously run expeirments - but now you can specify specific branches.  
- An example use is to rollout a winning message to everyone EXCEPT people that were in the treatments branch of the experiment (so people don't get related message variants again).

🛠️ Audience overlap

   > We now have warnings on Experimenter for three known cases of audience overlap. [These warnings](/faq/warnings) will prevent detectable cases of audience overlap, which generally result in under enrollment and can invalidate an experiment. (erichards) [EXP-4180](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-4180)

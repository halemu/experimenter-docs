## Experimenter

🛎️ Subscribe to notifications

   > Non-owners can now [subscribe to notifications](/notifications). Previously, these notifications were only being sent to experiment owners. This feature is available for all users and all experiments, and can be found in the Overview section on the Summary page of an experiment. (erichards) [EXP-4229](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-4229)


🙌 [Recipe branches are now available from the include/exclude dropdowns](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-4187).  
   > Not only can include and exclude running and previously run expeirments - but now you can specify specific branches.  
- An example use is to rollout a winning message to everyone EXCEPT people that were in the treatments branch of the experiment (so people don't get related message variants again).

🛠️ Audience overlap

   > We now have warnings on Experimenter for three known cases of audience overlap. [These warnings](/faq/warnings) will prevent detectable cases of audience overlap, which generally result in under enrollment and can invalidate an experiment. (erichards) [EXP-4180](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-4180)

🤖🍏💻  Helpful JSON Errors

   > As you are writing your JSON (the code that configures your feature in the Branches page), you may see ```Feature Manifest errors occured during validation``` followed by details.   Experimenter is now comparing your feature manifest with the branch JSON you entered.  It compares for all versions your experiments is targeting, as defined in your experiments Audience page with minimum version and maximum versions.  This makes sure that the JSON you just typed will work for your feature on all the targeted firefox version.   If there is an error message, it will include the property that didn't match the feature manifest, possible valid values, the line where the error is, and the version where that error happened.  If you have an issue - to resolve first check the minumum versions your experiment targets (on the Audience page) and make sure it is as intended.  If that is correct, next look at the line to see what aspect of the JSON is having an issue and how to resolve.
